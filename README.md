Useful commands to create docker containers and more. Star it for future refernce. 

Will be adding more here as I continue learning. 


1. First build an image in the root of your project folder 
2. In this example I use Node, so visit [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) and search for the particular version
3. In your docker file type the following.
 
```
FROM node:lts-gallium //use node version image from docker hub

CMD ["/bin/bash"] //
```
